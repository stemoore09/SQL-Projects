# SQL-Projects

A repository on GitHub of my learning journey with SQL, where I will be categorizing each chapter based off of certain functions (e.g. selections, aggravate functions, filtering, joins, etc.).

This will be using DataCamp's online database on SQL Server using T-SQL. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase learned skills and to be able to go back and review material.

# SQL-Projects

A repository on GitHub of my learning journey with SQL, where I will be categorizing each chapter based off of certain functions (e.g. basic SQL, selections, aggravate functions, filtering, joins, etc.). 

This repository will include Postgres on Udacity and T-SQL from DataCamp, and various challenges from HackerRank.  

All the data will be from using HackerRank, DataCamp & Udacity's online databases. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase learned skills and to be able to go back and review material.

# SQL-Projects

A repository on GitHub of my learning journey with SQL, where I will be categorizing each chapter based off of certain functions (e.g. basic SQL, selections, aggravate functions, filtering, joins, etc.). This repository will include Postgres on Udacity and T-SQL from DataCamp.  

All the data will be from using DataCamp's & Udacity's online database. 

The purpose of this repository is to showcase learned skills and to be able to go back and review material.

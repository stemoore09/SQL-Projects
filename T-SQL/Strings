We can find the length of a text column (number of characters, including spaces) using the LEN function. 
Knowing the total length of a string is a great starting point for string calculations. 


-- Calculate the length of the description column from the grid table
SELECT 
  LEN (description) AS description_length 
FROM 
  grid;


If we want to extract a number of characters from the beginning of a string, use the LEFT function.


-- Select the first 25 characters from the left of the description column
SELECT 
  LEFT(description, 25) AS first_25_left 
FROM 
  grid;


If we want to extract a number of charactesr from the end of a string, use the RIGHT function.


-- Amend the query to select 25 characters from the right of the description column
SELECT 
  RIGHT(description, 25) AS last_25_right 
FROM 
  grid;
  
  
The CHARINDEX function helps us find a specific character within a string.

Pattern String Criterion

--'Sha%' Character string can be any length but must begin with “Sha”
-- (e.g., Shannon, Sharon, Shawn)

--'%son' Character string can be any length but must end with “son”
-- (e.g., Benson, Johnson, Morrison)

--'%han%' Character string can be any length but must contain “han”
-- (e.g., Buchanan, handel, Johansen, Nathanson)


-- Complete the query to find `Weather` within the description column
SELECT 
  description, 
  CHARINDEX('weather', description) 
FROM 
  grid
WHERE description LIKE '%Weather%';

-- Complete the query to find the length of `Weather'
SELECT 
  description, 
  CHARINDEX('Weather', description) AS start_of_string,
  LEN('Weather') AS length_of_string 
FROM 
  grid
WHERE
  description LIKE '%weather%';

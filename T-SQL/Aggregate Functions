Basic Aggregate Functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX. Supported by all database systems. 

SUM Single Columns. Used to calculate the total amount of a specific column. 

-- Find the total amount of MRO's in the nerc_region from the Grid table, but don't include any missing values
SELECT 
  SUM(demand_loss_mw) AS total 
FROM 
  grid 
WHERE
  demand_loss_mw IS NOT NULL 
  AND nerc_region = 'mro';
 
 
 COUNT is used to determine the number of rows, or the number of non-null values in a result set.
 
  -- Obtain a count of 'grid_id'
SELECT 
  COUNT(grid_id) AS grid_total
FROM 
  grid;
  
  -- Obtain a count of RFC regions
SELECT 
  COUNT(grid_id) AS RFC_count
FROM 
  grid
WHERE
  nerc_region = 'RFC';
  
  
 MIN, MAX and AVG. MAX = Largest Value, MIN = Smallest Value, AVG = Sum of Values/Total # of Values . If the value expression is a date or time, the result set
 will be the latest date/time from the column or expression. 
 
 
-- Find the minimum number of affected customers
-- Only retrieve rows where demand_loss_mw has a value
SELECT 
  MIN(affected_customers) AS min_affected_customers 
FROM 
  grid
WHERE
  demand_loss_mw IS NOT NULL;
  
  --Next, find the maximum number of affected customers with the same parameters
SELECT 
  MAX(affected_customers) AS max_affected_customers 
FROM 
  grid
WHERE 
  demand_loss_mw IS NOT NULL;
  
  --Now, find the average number of affected customers with the same parameters
SELECT 
  AVG(affected_customers) AS avg_affected_customers 
FROM 
  grid
WHERE 
  demand_loss_mw IS NOT NULL;

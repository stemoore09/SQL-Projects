The datatype in a column impacts what values are returned from your expression. Every column has an assigned data type
that determines the types of values that can be stored in a column and the types of operations. 

CHARACTER - CHAR: Fixed-length character data type
CHARACTER VARYING - CHAR VARYING - VARCHAR: Varying-length character data type
CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT - CHAR LARGE OBJECT - CLOB: When the length of a character string exceeds a system-defined max. 
                                                   In many systems, the ALIAS for CLOB is TEXT or MEMO .

BOOLEAN: This data type stores true and false values, usually in a single binary bit. Some systems use BIT, INT, or 
         TINYINT to store this data type.

BINARY - BINARY LARGE OBJECT -  BLOB: Used to store binary data such as images, sounds, videos, embedded documents (word
                                      processing files, spreadsheets). In many systems, the ALIAS's used for this data
                                      type are BINARY, BIT, and BIT VARYING.

**Types of Expressions**

You will generally use the following three types of expressions when 
working with SQL statements:

  CONCATENATION: Combining two or more character columns or literals into a single character string

  MATHEMATICAL: Adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numeric columns or literals

  DATE AND TIME ARITHMETIC: Applying addition or subtraction to dates and times

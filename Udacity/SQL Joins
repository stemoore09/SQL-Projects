Inner Joins

INNER JOIN = JOIN

Syntax: SELECT table1.column_name, table2.column_name
        FROM table1
        JOIN table2
        ON table1.PK_column_name = table2.FK_column_name

1.) The table name is always before the period.
2.) The column you want from that table is always after the period.
3.) The ordering of which table name goes first in the ON statement doesn't matter.


--Try pulling all the data from the accounts table, and all the data from the orders table.
--The match is the Accounts ID which are included in both tables linking the information.
--Account ID in the Accounts Table = ID; The Account ID in the Orders Table = Account_ID. 

SELECT accounts.*,orders.*
FROM accounts
JOIN orders
ON accounts.id=orders.account_id;

--Try pulling standard_qty, gloss_qty, and poster_qty from the orders table, and the website and the primary_poc from the accounts table.
--The match is the Accounts ID which are included in both tables linking the information.
--Account ID in the Accounts Table = ID; The Account ID in the Orders Table = Account_ID. 

SELECT orders.standard_qty,orders.gloss_qty,orders.poster_qty,accounts.website,accounts.primary_poc
FROM accounts
JOIN orders
ON orders.account_id=accounts.id;

--Try pulling channel column from the web_events table, the name column from the accounts table & total orders from the orders tables.
--This query is pulling various columns from more than 2 tables using the same syntax logic. 

SELECT web_events.channel, accounts.name, orders.total
FROM web_events
JOIN accounts
ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id
JOIN orders
ON accounts.id = orders.account_id;


--Provide a table for all web_events associated with account name of Walmart. There should be three columns.
--Be sure to include the primary_poc, time of the event, and the channel for each event. 
--Additionally, you might choose to add a fourth column to assure only Walmart events were chosen.
  
SELECT a.primary_poc, w.occurred_at, w.channel, a.name
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a
ON w.account_id = a.id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart';

vs. with no aliases

SELECT accounts.primary_poc, accounts.name, web_events.channel, web_events.occurred_at
FROM web_events
JOIN accounts
ON web_events.account_id = accounts.id
WHERE accounts.name = 'Walmart';

--Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts.
--Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name.
--Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
